							Operating for several years in various locations as the only
							<strong> fully independent </strong>
							financial planning and investment firm in Northern Ontario we found a
							permanent home when we purchased the historic Barry Property on Bellevue
							Avenue shown below, located on an acre of land on the shores of Minnow
							Lake, which had just become available on the passing of
							<strong> Mrs. Barry, a pioneer resident of the area at age 89 in 2000.</strong>
							This property was zoned commercial so was ideal for our purpose although
							renovations were necessary to the home which was built in the 1930's. It
							was conveniently located close to our residence which made it even more
							attractive as we can walk to work. Our clients appreciate the
							<strong> warm and welcoming atmosphere </strong>
							of this fine old building.

								Focus on Lifestyle and All Aspects of Financial Planning
							</h3>
							<p class="mt-3">
								As our name implies, we help clients determine the best
								<strong> financial decisions </strong>
								based on their own and/or their families lifestyle goals and
								objectives. This is done though the development of a
								<strong> comprehensive financial plan </strong>
								which will consider all aspects including consideration of debt
								reduction and control through budgeting as well as saving and
								investing. Also protection through appropriate insurance if required.
								These <strong>plans are updated</strong> on a regular basis or as
								circumstances change.

								Change and the Stages of Life from Starting out to Retirement
							</h3>
							<p class="mt-3">
								<strong>The earlier you plan the better</strong> the results which
								include investing, as even small amounts grow to large over time. This
								is also the time to establish <strong>budgeting habits</strong> that
								endure over a lifetime. Marriage, starting a family and possibly home
								ownership, can mean setting and <strong>realizing goals</strong> through
								thoughtful financial planning. Considerations such as future education
								costs for children and putting aside money for other goals including
								eventual retirement. Besides short term savings for unexpected expenses
								and even vacations, investing longer term in
								<strong>
									Tax Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement plans
								</strong>
								can help. Not to be forgotten is protection through insurance.
								Entering into retirement requires careful evaluation of sources of
								income and lifestyle requirements as aging progresses. Later estate
								planning considerations become important. At Financial Decisions we
								have had <strong>years of dealing with clients</strong> at all stages of
								their life journey and enjoy helping with their lifestyle and financial
								matters so to the greatest extent possible they can realize their goals
								and dreams.
