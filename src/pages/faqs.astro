								Linda received recognition as
								<strong>Favorite Financial Planner</strong>
								on three separate occasions in newspaper polls.

								<strong>
									Financial speaker, educator and author Talbot Stevens had this to
									say:
								</strong>
								<em>
									"I am sincerely impressed with Linda Cartier's professionalism.
									Financial Planning is about identifying individual goals, detailing a
									plan to achieve these goals and following it through. Linda takes the
									time to get to know her clients and provide the most comprehensive
									financial plans I have ever seen."

									"I have worked with Linda Cartier as my personal financial planner for
									over 25 years. I have referred others to Linda in the expectation they
									will enjoy the same financial achievement as myself. Linda has been
									prompt in returning all my phone calls and answering questions. She
									possesses extensive knowledge and the patience to assist people in

								Focus on Lifestyle and All Aspects of Financial Planning
							</h2>
							<p class="mt-3">
								As our name implies, we help clients determine the best
								<strong> financial decisions </strong>
								based on their own and/or their families lifestyle goals and
								objectives. This is done though the development of a
								<strong> comprehensive financial plan </strong>
								which will consider all aspects including consideration of debt
								reduction and control through budgeting as well as saving and
								investing. Also protection through appropriate insurance if required.
								These <strong>plans are updated</strong> on a regular basis or as
								circumstances change.

								Change and the Stages of Life from Starting out to Retirement
							</h2>
							<p class="mt-3">
								<strong>The earlier you plan the better</strong> the results which
								include investing, as even small amounts grow to large over time. This
								is also the time to establish <strong>budgeting habits</strong> that
								endure over a lifetime. Marriage, starting a family and possibly home
								ownership, can mean setting and <strong>realizing goals</strong> through
								thoughtful financial planning. Considerations such as future education
								costs for children and putting aside money for other goals including
								eventual retirement. Besides short term savings for unexpected expenses
								and even vacations, investing longer term in
								<strong>
									Tax Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement plans
								</strong>
								can help. Not to be forgotten is protection through insurance.
								Entering into retirement requires careful evaluation of sources of
								income and lifestyle requirements as aging progresses. Later estate
								planning considerations become important. At Financial Decisions we
								have had <strong>years of dealing with clients</strong> at all stages of
								their life journey and enjoy helping with their lifestyle and financial
								matters so to the greatest extent possible they can realize their goals
								and dreams.
