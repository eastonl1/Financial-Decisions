            <p>Linda received recognition as “<strong>Favorite Financial Planner</strong>” on three separate occasions in newspaper polls.</p>
            <p><strong>Financial speaker, educator and author Talbot Stevens had this to say:</strong> <i>"I am sincerely impressed with Linda Cartier’s professionalism. Financial Planning is about identifying individual goals, detailing a plan to achieve these goals and following it through. Linda takes the time to get to know her clients and provide the most comprehensive financial plans I have ever seen."</i></p>
            <p><strong>D.M Thomson R.N. B.A. B.ScN</strong> <i>“I have worked with Linda Cartier as my personal financial planner for over 25 years. I have referred others to Linda in the expectation they will enjoy the same financial achievement as myself. Linda has been prompt in returning all my phone calls and answering questions. She possesses extensive knowledge and the patience to assist people in coming to a full understanding of their financial situation and to assist them in constructive solutions.”</i></p>

          <h2>Focus on Lifestyle and All Aspects of Financial Planning</h2>
          <p>As our name implies, we help clients determine the best “<strong>financial decisions</strong>” based on their own and/or their families lifestyle goals and objectives. This is done though the development of a <strong>comprehensive financial plan</strong> which will consider all aspects including consideration of debt reduction and control through budgeting as well as saving and investing. Also protection through appropriate insurance if required. These <strong>plans are updated</strong> on a regular basis or as circumstances change.</p>

          <h2>Change and the Stages of Life from Starting out to Retirement</h2>
          <p><strong>The earlier you plan the better</strong> the results which include investing, as even small amounts grow to large over time. This is also the time to establish <strong>budgeting habits</strong> that endure over a lifetime. Marriage, starting a family and possibly home ownership, can mean setting and <strong>realizing goals</strong> through thoughtful financial planning.
          Considerations such as future education costs for children and putting aside money for other goals including eventual retirement. Besides short term savings for unexpected expenses and even vacations, investing longer term in <strong>Tax Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement plans</strong> can help. Not to be forgotten is protection through insurance.
          Entering into retirement requires careful evaluation of sources of income and lifestyle requirements as aging progresses. Later estate planning considerations become important. At Financial Decisions we have had <strong>years of dealing with clients</strong> at all stages of their life journey and enjoy helping with their lifestyle and financial matters so to the greatest extent possible they can realize their goals and dreams.</p>
