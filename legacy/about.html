          <h2>Our Office Location</h2>
          <p>Operating for several years in various locations as the only <strong>fully independent</strong> financial planning and investment firm in Northern Ontario we found a permanent home when we purchased the historic Barry Property on Bellevue Avenue shown below, located on an acre of land on the shores of Minnow Lake, which had just become available on the passing of <strong>Mrs. Barry, a pioneer resident of the area at age 89 in 2000.</strong> This property was zoned commercial so was ideal for our purpose although renovations were necessary to the home which was built in the 1930's. It was conveniently located close to our residence which made it even more attractive as we can walk to work. Our clients appreciate the <strong>warm and welcoming atmosphere</strong> of this fine old building.</p>
